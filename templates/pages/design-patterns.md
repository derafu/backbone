## Design Patterns in Backbone

Derafu Backbone draws inspiration from several well-established design patterns. Understanding these patterns and their implementation in Backbone helps developers use the framework effectively and extend it appropriately.

## Jobs and the Command Pattern

Jobs in Backbone are a direct implementation of the Command Pattern.

### Command Pattern Overview

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing:

- Parameterization of clients with different requests.
- Queueing of requests.
- Logging of requests.
- Support for undoable operations.

### How Jobs Implement Command

Jobs in Backbone embody these principles:

- Each job is a class that encapsulates a single operation.
- Jobs have a standardized execution method (`execute()`).
- Jobs can be parameterized through their execute method.
- Jobs are self-contained and can be invoked by various clients.

```php
#[Job(name: 'create', worker: 'generator', component: 'invoice', package: 'billing')]
class CreateInvoiceJob extends AbstractJob implements JobInterface
{
    public function execute(array $data): Invoice
    {
        // Validate input.
        $this->validateInput($data);

        // Create invoice
        $invoice = new Invoice();
        $invoice->setCustomer($data['customer']);
        $invoice->setItems($data['items']);

        // Return result.
        return $invoice;
    }

    private function validateInput(array $data): void
    {
        // Validation logic.
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Command Pattern in Jobs

This implementation provides several advantages:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each job has a clear, specific purpose.
- **Reusability**: Jobs can be reused in different contexts.
- **Testability**: Jobs are easy to test in isolation.
- **Extensibility**: New jobs can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Queueability**: Jobs can be serialized and queued for asynchronous processing.

## Handlers and the Mediator/Chain of Responsibility Patterns

Handlers in Backbone combine aspects of both the Mediator and Chain of Responsibility patterns.

### Mediator Pattern Overview

The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly.

### Chain of Responsibility Overview

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers, with each handler deciding either to process the request or pass it to the next handler.

### How Handlers Implement These Patterns

Handlers in Backbone combine these concepts:

- They coordinate interactions between multiple Jobs (Mediator).
- They orchestrate a sequence of operations (Chain of Responsibility).
- They encapsulate complex workflows.

```php
#[Handler(name: 'process', worker: 'processor', component: 'invoice', package: 'billing')]
class ProcessInvoiceHandler extends AbstractHandler implements HandlerInterface
{
    public function handle(Invoice $invoice, array $options = []): Result
    {
        // Validate the invoice.
        $validationResult = $this->getJob('validate')->execute($invoice);
        if (!$validationResult->isValid()) {
            return Result::failure($validationResult->getErrors());
        }

        // Determine processing strategy.
        $strategyName = $options['strategy'] ?? 'default';
        $strategy = $this->getStrategy($strategyName);

        // Process the invoice.
        $processingResult = $strategy->process($invoice);
        if (!$processingResult->isSuccessful()) {
            return Result::failure($processingResult->getErrors());
        }

        // Send notifications.
        $this->getJob('notify')->execute($invoice, $options['notifications'] ?? []);

        // Return success.
        return Result::success(['invoice' => $invoice, 'processed' => true]);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of These Patterns in Handlers

This implementation provides several advantages:

- **Decoupling**: Components don't need to know about each other.
- **Centralized Control**: Complex workflows are managed in a single place.
- **Flexibility**: Processing steps can be changed without affecting clients.
- **Transactional Boundaries**: Handlers can manage transactions across multiple operations.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling for multi-step processes.

## Strategies and the Strategy Pattern

Strategies in Backbone are a direct implementation of the Strategy Pattern.

### Strategy Pattern Overview

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### How Strategies Implement the Pattern

Strategies in Backbone embody these principles:

- They provide alternative implementations of an algorithm.
- They share a common interface.
- They can be selected and switched at runtime.

```php
#[Strategy(name: 'pdf', worker: 'renderer', component: 'document', package: 'billing')]
class PdfRenderStrategy extends AbstractStrategy implements RenderStrategyInterface
{
    public function render(Document $document): string
    {
        // PDF rendering implementation.
        return $this->pdfRenderer->renderDocument($document);
    }
}

#[Strategy(name: 'html', worker: 'renderer', component: 'document', package: 'billing')]
class HtmlRenderStrategy extends AbstractStrategy implements RenderStrategyInterface
{
    public function render(Document $document): string
    {
        // HTML rendering implementation.
        return $this->htmlRenderer->renderDocument($document);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

This implementation provides several advantages:

- **Encapsulation**: Different algorithms are encapsulated in separate classes.
- **Interchangeability**: Strategies can be swapped without changing client code.
- **Elimination of Conditionals**: Complex conditional logic is replaced with polymorphism.
- **Runtime Selection**: Algorithms can be selected based on runtime conditions.
- **Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently.

## Workers and the Facade Pattern

Workers in Backbone implement the Facade Pattern.

### Facade Pattern Overview

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### How Workers Implement the Facade

Workers in Backbone act as facades:

- They provide a simplified interface to complex subsystems.
- They handle the complexity of coordinating jobs, handlers, and strategies.
- They expose domain operations through a clean API.

```php
#[Worker(name: 'processor', component: 'invoice', package: 'billing')]
class InvoiceProcessorWorker extends AbstractWorker implements WorkerInterface
{
    // This method is part of the public API.
    public function processInvoice(Invoice $invoice, array $options = []): Result
    {
        // Delegate to the appropriate handler.
        return $this->getHandler('process')->handle($invoice, $options);
    }

    // Another public API method.
    public function validateInvoice(Invoice $invoice): ValidationResult
    {
        // Delegate to a job.
        return $this->getJob('validate')->execute($invoice);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Facade Pattern in Workers

This implementation provides several advantages:

- **Simplified Interface**: Clients interact with a clean, focused API.
- **Reduced Coupling**: Clients don't need to know about the subsystem's components.
- **Unified Entry Point**: Workers provide a single entry point to related functionality.
- **Abstraction**: Implementation details are hidden behind the facade.

## Hexagonal Architecture Influence

The overall architecture of Backbone is inspired by Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters).

### Hexagonal Architecture Overview

Hexagonal Architecture aims to create loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters.

### How Backbone Implements Hexagonal Concepts

Backbone incorporates these principles:

- **Domain-Centric**: The architecture focuses on domain logic.
- **Ports**: Interfaces define how components interact.
- **Adapters**: Implementations connect the domain to external systems.
- **Inversion of Control**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain.

The Package-Component-Worker structure creates clear boundaries within the domain, while Strategies often serve as adapters to external systems.

## Practical Application

When applying these design patterns in your Backbone applications:

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Recognize which pattern applies to your situation.
2. **Follow the Template**: Use the appropriate Backbone component.
3. **Respect the Boundaries**: Maintain separation between different components.
4. **Leverage Polymorphism**: Use strategies for variant implementations.
5. **Focus on Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance.

By understanding and applying these design patterns within Backbone, you can create well-structured, maintainable applications that are flexible enough to adapt to changing requirements.
